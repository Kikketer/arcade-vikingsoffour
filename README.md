# Vikings of Four

> Open this page at [https://cjweed.com/arcade-vikingsoffour/](https://cjweed.com/arcade-vikingsoffour/)

The 4 player viking game primarily used as a test for the 4 player setup of my arcade box.

- You are one of four vikings on your ship. You must row to shore before the Kraken gets you!
- Make sure you row to the beat! Your boat will move faster if you are all in sync
- Shooting arrows at enemies requires having an arrow loaded, the Viking across from you will load your arrow
- Loading the arrow requires following a rythm as well, be sure to tap at the right rate to load the arrow properly

## TODO:

- Add the "press now to load" sprite (3 dots, on 3rd is when to push to keep loading)
- Add the "kraken" timer, you must row to the finish before it gets you
- Allow to play with only 2 players
    - 2 player - the game is "just" beatable with perfect rowing
    - 4 player - you have some freedom to fail due to how fast you move

## Crazy Idea Pile

- What if we had two arcade boxes, 4 player each and battled each-other?
- A larger area including turning
