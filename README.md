The 4 player viking game primarily used as a test for the 4 player setup of my arcade box.


## TODO:

- Single tilemap for the "ocean"
- Enemies randomly float about but will head to you if you are close
- Once all enemies are dead you move to the next level

## Crazy Idea Pile

- What if we had two arcade boxes, 4 player each and battled each-other?
