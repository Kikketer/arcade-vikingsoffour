The 4 player viking game primarily used as a test for the 4 player setup of my arcade box.

## TODO:

- Have the other side of the boat load while the other shoots
- Once all enemies are dead you move to the next level

## Crazy Idea Pile

- For now simply move streight and "land" to invade the settlement
- What if we had two arcade boxes, 4 player each and battled each-other?
- A larger area including turning
